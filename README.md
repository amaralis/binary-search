# BINARY SEARCH DEMO

This is a little demonstration of how a binary search works, created for a class project. The user can choose a list size and a target to look for, and they will be able to see how the search is conducted, step by step, as well as read up on the theory behind the algorithm.

## HOW TO USE

Use the inputs on the right panel (or scroll down until you find them if your display isn't very wide) to choose the size of the list you want to search, and a number to search for. Click "Next Step" until that number is found. Every time the button is clicked, and explanation of the step taken is displayed.

On the the other panel, you can find a little explanation of how time complexity works, which is interesting and important knowledge for search and iteration algorithms.
